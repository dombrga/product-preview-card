## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned picture element.

### Continued development

Practice more on CSS and maybe use framework like React.
Use CSS custom properties and create more descriptive class names. 
Also try using display grid.
